                            <p>California law requires you to call the school when your child does not come to school and to write a note explaining the absence. 
                                Please do not send your children if they are ill (have a fever, skin rashes, inflamed eyes, headaches, etc.) School instruction starts 
                                promptly at 8:40 a.m. for the middle school and 9:30am for elementary school. We expect all students to arrive on time. If a student is 
                                routinely late, the school will contact the parents. Please send a note when your child is to be excused early from school.</p>

                            <p>Students are not allowed to receive phone calls or messages during school. If there is an emergency and you need to get a message to your child, please call 
                                the school office. Emergency Information Card is Critical. Include your cell and all day and evening phone numbers so the school can reach you. If you change 
                                a phone number, send in a written note to the office. The school must have information to contact you if your child is sick or in case of emergency. Your child's 
                                teacher needs to be able to reach you to discuss your child. Positive communication strengthens the Home/School partnership!.</p>
